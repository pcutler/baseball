<h1>Overview </h1>

This the repository for [mlbpool2.com](http://mlbpool2.com).

MLBPool2 is a "pick 'em" pool for baseball and football where league members choose individual leaders in different categories, division winners and losers,
and other statistical categories at the beginning of a season.

Players can change their picks at the All-Star break, though those changes are only worth half points.  Those are the only things a player has to manage through the entire season.  The football pool does not offer the ability to change picks midway through the season.

<h1>History</h1>

The MLBPool is the brain child of former commissioner Jason Theros who created the league and rules.  Sadly, MLBPool came to an end after the 2011 season.

MLBPool2 rose from the ashes in 2013 and in 2015 we added football.

<h1>Future Development</h1>

At some point in 2016, I hope to start development in Python to automate the statistics collection for both the MLB and NFL pools.  This is all currently done by hand.
