MLBPool2 is a "pick 'em" pool for baseball where league members choose
individual leaders in different categories, division winners and losers,
and other statistical categories.

Players can change their picks at the All-Star break, though those
changes are only worth half points.

The MLBPool is the brain child of former commissioner Jason Theros who
created the league and rules.  Sadly, MLBPool came to an end after the
2011 season.

MLBPool2 rose from the ashes in 2013 and in 2015 we added football.

This repository hosts the Wordpress installation, plugins and theme for
[mlbpool2.com](http://mlbpool2.com).

At some point in 2016, I hope to integrate and / or create
some Python programs to automate the statistics collection for both the MLB and
NFL pools.  This is all currently done by hand.
